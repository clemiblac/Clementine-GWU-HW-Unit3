    # Ask the user how many numbers to loop through
    

    # Loop through the numbers. (Be sure to cast the string into an integer.)
    
    
        # Print each number in the range
    

    # Set the next start number as the last number of the loop
  
    # Once complete... ask if the user wants to continue
     
        # If "y", restart the process, starting at 0 again.
    
        # If "n", exit the chain.
